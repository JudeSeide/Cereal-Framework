# Cereal
### A php framework for the lazy ones

## Introduction

 _The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris._ Larry Wall
 
 You just had a _brillant_ idea, and feel the urge to code the next big thing.
 Because of _best practices_, you'll probably choose a framework. Maybe you'll
 even try the hot new one the internet is bragging about.
 
 Instead of thinking about your project design, architecture or more interesting subject, 
 you're now digging into a huge framework doc, trying to figure out where to begin.
 
 Cereal aim to solve that, not feeling like cooking ? Take a bowl!
