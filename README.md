# Cereal
### A php framework for the lazy ones

## Introduction

 _The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris._ Larry Wall
 
 You just had a _brillant_ idea, and feel the urge to code the next big thing.
 But because of _best practices_ you'll probably choose a framework, maybe
 even try the hot new one you've be reading/hearing about.
 
 Instead of thiking about your project design, you're now digging into a huge
 framework doc, trying to figure out where to begin.
 
 Cereal aim to solve that, not feeling like cooking ? Take a bowl!
